### Tree Instance Propagation to Original Plot Point Cloud 

This repo contains two scripts aimed at removing points present in tree instances from original plot point clouds using distance-based thresholding.  
Given a set of segmented tree point clouds, and the original, unedited plot point cloud, in the same coordinate system, the segmented tree points will be propagated to the plot point cloud and removed.

#### ðŸ“„ `propagate_predictions.py`

This script **creates a propagated point cloud** (i.e., the original plot point cloud without the segmented trees).

**How to run:**
Replace the paths in the `main` function at the bottom of the script and execute the Python file.

**Dependencies:**  
- `open3d`  
- `laspy`  
(Tested using Ubuntu + Python 3.10)

**Notes:**
- The trees must be in the **original coordinate system** (e.g. the same coordinate system as the plot point cloud).
- With minor adaptations, the same code can be used to **label** (instead of remove) points â€” e.g., for instance segmentation training/testing data.
- The script reads **`.las` files**. To use `.ply` or `.txt`, write a custom reader function with the same output format as `read_las_np`, and adjust other functions accordingly.
- The algorithm is split into two steps due to potential **memory issues**, especially with undownsampled data.
    - If the function fails in the second step, a **plot mask** is saved as an `.npy` file.
    - You can **load the saved mask** in the `main` function to avoid recomputing.

#### ðŸ“„ `tree_extraction.py`

This script creates both:
1. A **propagated point cloud** in **`.las`** format
2. **Individual tree point clouds** in **`.las`** format using points from the original plot point cloud.

**How to run:**  
Execute from the command line:

```bash
python tree_extraction.py <input_file.las> <input_directory> <output_directory> <propagated_file.las> --distance_th <value>
```

**Example:**
```bash
python tree_extraction.py /path/to/input.las /path/to/input_dir/ /path/to/output_dir/ /path/to/propagated.las --distance_th 0.015
```

**Dependencies:**  
- `open3d`  
- `laspy`
- laz backends
  - `lazrs` or,
  - `laszip`
- `argparse`

**Notes:**
- The trees must be in the **original coordinate system** (e.g. the same coordinate system as the plot point cloud).
- The script reads **`.las`, `.laz` and `.ply` files** automatically. It recognizes if you have a laz backend installed.
- As with the other script, the algorithm is split into two steps due to **memory constraints**.
    - If the second step fails, the **plot mask** is saved as an `.npy` file and can be **reloaded later**.
